  EleFront is all about managing model data and enhancing how you interact with objects in Rhino. Assign information directly to your geometry, to turn your model into a dynamic database, and a true "Building Information Model".  Reference and filter your objects with the custom metadata you've added. Construct and Deconstruct Blocks, with persistent metadata, to manage a huge number of objects that can all be intelligent. Plus, components for creating annotations in Grasshopper for baking into Rhino.
